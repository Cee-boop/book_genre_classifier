# Book Genre Classifier
### Experimenting with NLP and text classification.
_
#### GOALS:
- Gain experience creating various databases
- Gain experience with text preprocessing
- Gain experience with visualising text data
- Gain experience with modeling text data using machine learning

This repo basically records all my trial and errors with creating a text classifier that can predict a genre of a book by using its synopsis (Fantasy, Romance, Science Fiction, Thriller). There are 7 notebooks going through various steps in this project, it's not pretty at all but hey ho.
